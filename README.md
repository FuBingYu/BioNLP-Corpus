##  	BC2GM
https://github.com/spyysalo/bc2gm-corpus

Provides a corpus of scientific texts, used for BioCreative, a competition in which participants are given well defined text-mining or information extraction tasks in the biological domain. BC2GM-corpus consists mainly of the training and testing corpora from BioCreative I and the testing corpus for the current task consists of an additional 5,000 sentences that were held 'in reserve'.

SPECIES: a standalone command line application capable of identifying taxonomic mentions in documents and mapping them to corresponding NCBI Taxonomy database entries.

Given a folder with plain text files, SPECIES based on its taxonomic name and synonym dictionary reports the taxonomic mentions (start, end position in each document), the detected term and the corresponding NCBI Taxonomy database record identifier.

Besides binomials following the Linnaean naming convention, recognised taxonomic mentions include acronyms, common names and abbreviations, as well as misspellings and the rest of the naming types supported by the NCBI Taxonomy.
